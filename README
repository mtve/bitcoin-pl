Bitcoin implemented in perl, meant to be portable.

Status:
 Work in progress.

Usage:
 perl bitcoin.pl

Note:
 For speed try to place db file on memory filesystem like this:
   mount -t tmpfs -o size=10g tmpfs /.1
   mount -o remount,size=40g tmpfs /.1
 Still it's pathetically slow when DB size is more then RAM, it
 loads around five blocks per minute when at block number 240000 (summer'13),
 and it's IO bound.   Need to reconsider the data scheme.

Features:
- web interface
- data stored in SQL database via DBI (SQLite by default)
- blockchain download
- chain branches
- key management with confirmed amount and unconfirmed delta
